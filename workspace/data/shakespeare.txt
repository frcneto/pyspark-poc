hamlet@1014	ACT I
hamlet@1020	
hamlet@1021	
hamlet@1022	
hamlet@1023	SCENE I	Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
hamlet@1071	
hamlet@1072	
hamlet@1073		[FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO]
hamlet@1121	
hamlet@1122	BERNARDO	Who's there?
hamlet@1144	
hamlet@1145	FRANCISCO	Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
hamlet@1199	
hamlet@1200	BERNARDO	Long live the king!
hamlet@1229	
hamlet@1230	FRANCISCO	Bernardo?
hamlet@1250	
hamlet@1251	BERNARDO	He.
hamlet@1264	
hamlet@1265	FRANCISCO	You come most carefully upon your hour.
hamlet@1315	
hamlet@1316	BERNARDO	'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
hamlet@1377	
hamlet@1378	FRANCISCO	For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
hamlet@1435		And I am sick at heart.
hamlet@1460	
hamlet@1461	BERNARDO	Have you had quiet guard?
hamlet@1496	
hamlet@1497	FRANCISCO	Not a mouse stirring.
hamlet@1529	
hamlet@1530	BERNARDO	Well, good night.
hamlet@1557		If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
hamlet@1596		The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
hamlet@1642	
hamlet@1643	FRANCISCO	I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
hamlet@1698	
hamlet@1699		[Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS]
hamlet@1730	
hamlet@1731	HORATIO	Friends to this ground.
hamlet@1763	
hamlet@1764	MARCELLUS	And liegemen to the Dane.
hamlet@1800	
hamlet@1801	FRANCISCO	Give you good night.
hamlet@1832	
hamlet@1833	MARCELLUS	O, farewell, honest soldier:
hamlet@1872		Who hath relieved you?
hamlet@1896	
hamlet@1897	FRANCISCO	Bernardo has my place.
hamlet@1930		Give you good night.
hamlet@1952	
hamlet@1953		[Exit]
hamlet@1961	
hamlet@1962	MARCELLUS	Holla! Bernardo!
hamlet@1989	
hamlet@1990	BERNARDO	Say,
hamlet@2004		What, is Horatio there?
hamlet@2029	
hamlet@2030	HORATIO	A piece of him.
hamlet@2054	
hamlet@2055	BERNARDO	Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
hamlet@2107	
hamlet@2108	MARCELLUS	What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
hamlet@2164	
hamlet@2165	BERNARDO	I have seen nothing.
hamlet@2195	
hamlet@2196	MARCELLUS	Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
hamlet@2241		And will not let belief take hold of him
hamlet@2283		Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
hamlet@2331		Therefore I have entreated him along
hamlet@2369		With us to watch the minutes of this night;
hamlet@2414		That if again this apparition come,
hamlet@2451		He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
hamlet@2493	
hamlet@2494	HORATIO	Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
hamlet@2533	
hamlet@2534	BERNARDO	Sit down awhile;
hamlet@2560		And let us once again assail your ears,
hamlet@2601		That are so fortified against our story
hamlet@2642		What we have two nights seen.
hamlet@2673	
hamlet@2674	HORATIO	Well, sit we down,
hamlet@2701		And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
hamlet@2742	
hamlet@2743	BERNARDO	Last night of all,
hamlet@2771		When yond same star that's westward from the pole
hamlet@2822		Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
hamlet@2873		Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
hamlet@2916		The bell then beating one,--
hamlet@2946	
hamlet@2947		[Enter Ghost]
hamlet@2962	
hamlet@2963	MARCELLUS	Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
hamlet@3024	
hamlet@3025	BERNARDO	In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
hamlet@3081	
hamlet@3082	MARCELLUS	Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
hamlet@3134	
hamlet@3135	BERNARDO	Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.
hamlet@3191	
hamlet@3192	HORATIO	Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
hamlet@3247	
hamlet@3248	BERNARDO	It would be spoke to.
hamlet@3279	
hamlet@3280	MARCELLUS	Question it, Horatio.
hamlet@3312	
hamlet@3313	HORATIO	What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
hamlet@3369		Together with that fair and warlike form
hamlet@3411		In which the majesty of buried Denmark
hamlet@3451		Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
hamlet@3505	
hamlet@3506	MARCELLUS	It is offended.
hamlet@3532	
hamlet@3533	BERNARDO	                  See, it stalks away!
hamlet@3581	
hamlet@3582	HORATIO	Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
hamlet@3632	
hamlet@3633		[Exit Ghost]
hamlet@3647	
hamlet@3648	MARCELLUS	'Tis gone, and will not answer.
hamlet@3690	
hamlet@3691	BERNARDO	How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
hamlet@3745		Is not this something more than fantasy?
hamlet@3787		What think you on't?
hamlet@3809	
hamlet@3810	HORATIO	Before my God, I might not this believe
hamlet@3858		Without the sensible and true avouch
hamlet@3896		Of mine own eyes.
hamlet@3915	
hamlet@3916	MARCELLUS	                  Is it not like the king?
hamlet@3969	
hamlet@3970	HORATIO	As thou art to thyself:
hamlet@4002		Such was the very armour he had on
hamlet@4038		When he the ambitious Norway combated;
hamlet@4078		So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
hamlet@4124		He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
hamlet@4166		'Tis strange.
hamlet@4181	
hamlet@4182	MARCELLUS	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
hamlet@4239		With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
hamlet@4286	
hamlet@4287	HORATIO	In what particular thought to work I know not;
hamlet@4342		But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
hamlet@4385		This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
hamlet@4433	
hamlet@4434	MARCELLUS	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
hamlet@4492		Why this same strict and most observant watch
hamlet@4539		So nightly toils the subject of the land,
hamlet@4582		And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
hamlet@4625		And foreign mart for implements of war;
hamlet@4666		Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
hamlet@4716		Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
hamlet@4759		What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
hamlet@4805		Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
hamlet@4855		Who is't that can inform me?
hamlet@4885	
hamlet@4886	HORATIO	That can I;
hamlet@4906		At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
hamlet@4953		Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
hamlet@4995		Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
hamlet@5039		Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
hamlet@5084		Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
hamlet@5136		For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
hamlet@5188		Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
hamlet@5240		Well ratified by law and heraldry,
hamlet@5276		Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
hamlet@5325		Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
hamlet@5370		Against the which, a moiety competent
hamlet@5409		Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
hamlet@5452		To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
hamlet@5487		Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
hamlet@5538		And carriage of the article design'd,
hamlet@5577		His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
hamlet@5626		Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
hamlet@5662		Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
hamlet@5707		Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
hamlet@5748		For food and diet, to some enterprise
hamlet@5787		That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
hamlet@5834		As it doth well appear unto our state--
hamlet@5875		But to recover of us, by strong hand
hamlet@5913		And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
hamlet@5959		So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
hamlet@6004		Is the main motive of our preparations,
hamlet@6045		The source of this our watch and the chief head
hamlet@6094		Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
hamlet@6138	
hamlet@6139	BERNARDO	I think it be no other but e'en so:
hamlet@6184		Well may it sort that this portentous figure
hamlet@6230		Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
hamlet@6279		That was and is the question of these wars.
hamlet@6324	
hamlet@6325	HORATIO	A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
hamlet@6373		In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
hamlet@6416		A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
hamlet@6457		The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
hamlet@6507		Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
hamlet@6552		As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
hamlet@6601		Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
hamlet@6643		Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
hamlet@6689		Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
hamlet@6732		And even the like precurse of fierce events,
hamlet@6778		As harbingers preceding still the fates
hamlet@6819		And prologue to the omen coming on,
hamlet@6856		Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
hamlet@6901		Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
hamlet@6940		But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
hamlet@6985	
hamlet@6986		[Re-enter Ghost]
hamlet@7004	
hamlet@7005		I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
hamlet@7057		If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
hamlet@7099		Speak to me:
hamlet@7113		If there be any good thing to be done,
hamlet@7153		That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
hamlet@7196		Speak to me:
hamlet@7210	
hamlet@7211		[Cock crows]
hamlet@7225	
hamlet@7226		If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
hamlet@7268		Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
hamlet@7318		Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
hamlet@7357		Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
hamlet@7398		For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
hamlet@7451		Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
hamlet@7502	
hamlet@7503	MARCELLUS	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
hamlet@7552	
hamlet@7553	HORATIO	Do, if it will not stand.
hamlet@7587	
hamlet@7588	BERNARDO	'Tis here!
hamlet@7608	
hamlet@7609	HORATIO	'Tis here!
hamlet@7628	
hamlet@7629	MARCELLUS	'Tis gone!
hamlet@7650	
hamlet@7651		[Exit Ghost]
hamlet@7665	
hamlet@7666		We do it wrong, being so majestical,
hamlet@7704		To offer it the show of violence;
hamlet@7739		For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
hamlet@7777		And our vain blows malicious mockery.
hamlet@7816	
hamlet@7817	BERNARDO	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
hamlet@7869	
hamlet@7870	HORATIO	And then it started like a guilty thing
hamlet@7918		Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
hamlet@7957		The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
hamlet@8001		Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
hamlet@8049		Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
hamlet@8093		Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
hamlet@8135		The extravagant and erring spirit hies
hamlet@8175		To his confine: and of the truth herein
hamlet@8216		This present object made probation.
hamlet@8253	
hamlet@8254	MARCELLUS	It faded on the crowing of the cock.
hamlet@8301		Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
hamlet@8347		Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
hamlet@8391		The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
hamlet@8436		And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
hamlet@8486		The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
hamlet@8537		No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
hamlet@8585		So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
hamlet@8627	
hamlet@8628	HORATIO	So have I heard and do in part believe it.
hamlet@8679		But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
hamlet@8724		Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
hamlet@8771		Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
hamlet@8813		Let us impart what we have seen to-night
hamlet@8855		Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
hamlet@8894		This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
hamlet@8939		Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
hamlet@8986		As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
hamlet@9030	
hamlet@9031	MARCELLUS	Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
hamlet@9085		Where we shall find him most conveniently.

hamlet@9153	
hamlet@9154	ACT I
hamlet@9160	
hamlet@9161	
hamlet@9162	
hamlet@9163	SCENE II	A room of state in the castle.
hamlet@9203	
hamlet@9204	
hamlet@9205		[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,
hamlet@9252		POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
hamlet@9301		and Attendants]
hamlet@9318	
hamlet@9319	KING CLAUDIUS	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
hamlet@9379		The memory be green, and that it us befitted
hamlet@9425		To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
hamlet@9476		To be contracted in one brow of woe,
hamlet@9514		Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
hamlet@9561		That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
hamlet@9603		Together with remembrance of ourselves.
hamlet@9644		Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
hamlet@9691		The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
hamlet@9738		Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
hamlet@9781		With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
hamlet@9821		With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
hamlet@9872		In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
hamlet@9917		Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
hamlet@9959		Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
hamlet@10004		With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
hamlet@10050		Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
hamlet@10097		Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
hamlet@10136		Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
hamlet@10182		Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
hamlet@10226		Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
hamlet@10271		He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
hamlet@10318		Importing the surrender of those lands
hamlet@10358		Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
hamlet@10402		To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
hamlet@10449		Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
hamlet@10496		Thus much the business is: we have here writ
hamlet@10542		To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
hamlet@10583		Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
hamlet@10626		Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
hamlet@10670		His further gait herein; in that the levies,
hamlet@10716		The lists and full proportions, are all made
hamlet@10762		Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
hamlet@10804		You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
hamlet@10846		For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
hamlet@10891		Giving to you no further personal power
hamlet@10932		To business with the king, more than the scope
hamlet@10980		Of these delated articles allow.
hamlet@11014		Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
hamlet@11063	
hamlet@11064	
hamlet@11065	CORNELIUS	|
hamlet@11077		|  In that and all things will we show our duty.
hamlet@11127	VOLTIMAND	|
hamlet@11139	
hamlet@11140	
hamlet@11141	KING CLAUDIUS	We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
hamlet@11195	
hamlet@11196		[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
hamlet@11230	
hamlet@11231		And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
hamlet@11276		You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
hamlet@11323		You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
hamlet@11364		And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
hamlet@11419		That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
hamlet@11464		The head is not more native to the heart,
hamlet@11507		The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
hamlet@11549		Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
hamlet@11595		What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
hamlet@11629	
hamlet@11630	LAERTES	My dread lord,
hamlet@11653		Your leave and favour to return to France;
hamlet@11697		From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
hamlet@11746		To show my duty in your coronation,
hamlet@11783		Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
hamlet@11825		My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
hamlet@11874		And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
hamlet@11923	
hamlet@11924	KING CLAUDIUS	Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
hamlet@11988	
hamlet@11989	LORD POLONIUS	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
hamlet@12049		By laboursome petition, and at last
hamlet@12086		Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
hamlet@12127		I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
hamlet@12168	
hamlet@12169	KING CLAUDIUS	Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
hamlet@12227		And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
hamlet@12270		But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
hamlet@12312	
hamlet@12313	HAMLET	[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.
hamlet@12373	
hamlet@12374	KING CLAUDIUS	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
hamlet@12433	
hamlet@12434	HAMLET	Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
hamlet@12484	
hamlet@12485	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
hamlet@12542		And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
hamlet@12592		Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
hamlet@12630		Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
hamlet@12670		Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
hamlet@12722		Passing through nature to eternity.
hamlet@12759	
hamlet@12760	HAMLET	Ay, madam, it is common.
hamlet@12792	
hamlet@12793	QUEEN GERTRUDE	If it be,
hamlet@12818		Why seems it so particular with thee?
hamlet@12857	
hamlet@12858	HAMLET	Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
hamlet@12910		'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
hamlet@12954		Nor customary suits of solemn black,
hamlet@12992		Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
hamlet@13033		No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
hamlet@13073		Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
hamlet@13114		Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
hamlet@13164		That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
hamlet@13210		For they are actions that a man might play:
hamlet@13255		But I have that within which passeth show;
hamlet@13299		These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
hamlet@13346	
hamlet@13347	KING CLAUDIUS	'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
hamlet@13412		To give these mourning duties to your father:
hamlet@13459		But, you must know, your father lost a father;
hamlet@13507		That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
hamlet@13559		In filial obligation for some term
hamlet@13595		To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
hamlet@13637		In obstinate condolement is a course
hamlet@13675		Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
hamlet@13721		It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
hamlet@13764		A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
hamlet@13804		An understanding simple and unschool'd:
hamlet@13845		For what we know must be and is as common
hamlet@13888		As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
hamlet@13928		Why should we in our peevish opposition
hamlet@13969		Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
hamlet@14017		A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
hamlet@14063		To reason most absurd: whose common theme
hamlet@14106		Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
hamlet@14154		From the first corse till he that died to-day,
hamlet@14202		'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
hamlet@14250		This unprevailing woe, and think of us
hamlet@14290		As of a father: for let the world take note,
hamlet@14336		You are the most immediate to our throne;
hamlet@14379		And with no less nobility of love
hamlet@14414		Than that which dearest father bears his son,
hamlet@14461		Do I impart toward you. For your intent
hamlet@14502		In going back to school in Wittenberg,
hamlet@14542		It is most retrograde to our desire:
hamlet@14580		And we beseech you, bend you to remain
hamlet@14620		Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
hamlet@14664		Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

hamlet@14770		I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.

hamlet@14821	HAMLET	I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
hamlet@14868	
hamlet@14869	KING CLAUDIUS	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
hamlet@14920		Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
hamlet@14960		This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
hamlet@15003		Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
hamlet@15048		No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
hamlet@15094		But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
hamlet@15142		And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
hamlet@15193		Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.

hamlet@15260	
hamlet@15261	HAMLET	O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
hamlet@15312		Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
hamlet@15349		Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
hamlet@15388		His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
hamlet@15435		How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
hamlet@15477		Seem to me all the uses of this world!
hamlet@15517		Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
hamlet@15561		That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
hamlet@15614		Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
hamlet@15663		But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
hamlet@15712		So excellent a king; that was, to this,
hamlet@15753		Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
hamlet@15798		That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
hamlet@15844		Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
hamlet@15891		Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
hamlet@15937		As if increase of appetite had grown
hamlet@15975		By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
hamlet@16021		Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
hamlet@16075		A little month, or ere those shoes were old
hamlet@16120		With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
hamlet@16168		Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
hamlet@16213		O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
hamlet@16263		Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
hamlet@16314		My father's brother, but no more like my father
hamlet@16363		Than I to Hercules: within a month:
hamlet@16400		Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
hamlet@16444		Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
hamlet@16487		She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
hamlet@16531		With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
hamlet@16574		It is not nor it cannot come to good:
hamlet@16613		But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

hamlet@16772		Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
hamlet@16806	
hamlet@16807	HORATIO	The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
hamlet@16862	
hamlet@16863	HAMLET	Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
hamlet@16923		And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
hamlet@16979	
hamlet@16980	MARCELLUS	My good lord--
hamlet@17005	
hamlet@17006	HAMLET	I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
hamlet@17056		But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
hamlet@17103	
hamlet@17104	HORATIO	A truant disposition, good my lord.
hamlet@17148	
hamlet@17149	HAMLET	I would not hear your enemy say so,
hamlet@17192		Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
hamlet@17234		To make it truster of your own report

hamlet@17356		We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
hamlet@17403	
hamlet@17404	HORATIO	My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
hamlet@17458	
hamlet@17459	HAMLET	I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
hamlet@17511		I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
hamlet@17555	
hamlet@17556	HORATIO	Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
hamlet@17604	
hamlet@17605	HAMLET	Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
hamlet@17661		Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
hamlet@17708		Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
hamlet@17750		Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
hamlet@17789		My father!--methinks I see my father.

hamlet@17829	HORATIO	Where, my lord?
hamlet@17853	
hamlet@17854	HAMLET	                  In my mind's eye, Horatio.
hamlet@17906	
hamlet@17907	HORATIO	I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
hamlet@17953	
hamlet@17954	HAMLET	He was a man, take him for all in all,
hamlet@18000		I shall not look upon his like again.
hamlet@18039	
hamlet@18040	HORATIO	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
hamlet@18088	
hamlet@18089	HAMLET	Saw? who?
hamlet@18106	
hamlet@18107	HORATIO	My lord, the king your father.
hamlet@18146	
hamlet@18147	HAMLET	The king my father!
hamlet@18174	
hamlet@18175	HORATIO	Season your admiration for awhile
hamlet@18217		With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
hamlet@18258		Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
hamlet@18296		This marvel to you.
hamlet@18317	
hamlet@18318	HAMLET	For God's love, let me hear.
hamlet@18354	
hamlet@18355	HORATIO	Two nights together had these gentlemen,
hamlet@18404		Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
hamlet@18445		In the dead vast and middle of the night,
hamlet@18488		Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
hamlet@18539		Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
hamlet@18574		Appears before them, and with solemn march
hamlet@18618		Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
hamlet@18667		By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
hamlet@18712		Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
hamlet@18767		Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
hamlet@18806		Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
hamlet@18851		In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
hamlet@18889		And I with them the third night kept the watch;
hamlet@18938		Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
hamlet@18983		Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
hamlet@19033		The apparition comes: I knew your father;
hamlet@19076		These hands are not more like.
hamlet@19108	
hamlet@19109	HAMLET	But where was this?
hamlet@19136	
hamlet@19137	MARCELLUS	My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
hamlet@19192	
hamlet@19193	HAMLET	Did you not speak to it?
hamlet@19225	
hamlet@19226	HORATIO	My lord, I did;
hamlet@19250		But answer made it none: yet once methought
hamlet@19295		It lifted up its head and did address
hamlet@19334		Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
hamlet@19377		But even then the morning cock crew loud,
hamlet@19420		And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
hamlet@19463		And vanish'd from our sight.
hamlet@19493	
hamlet@19494	HAMLET	'Tis very strange.
hamlet@19520	
hamlet@19521	HORATIO	As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
hamlet@19572		And we did think it writ down in our duty
hamlet@19615		To let you know of it.
hamlet@19639	
hamlet@19640	HAMLET	Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
hamlet@19691		Hold you the watch to-night?

hamlet@19929	
hamlet@19930	
hamlet@19931	HAMLET	Then saw you not his face?
hamlet@19965	
hamlet@19966	HORATIO	O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
hamlet@20014	
hamlet@20015	HAMLET	What, look'd he frowningly?
hamlet@20050	
hamlet@20051	HORATIO	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
hamlet@20103	
hamlet@20104	HAMLET	Pale or red?
hamlet@20124	
hamlet@20125	HORATIO	Nay, very pale.
hamlet@20149	
hamlet@20150	HAMLET	                  And fix'd his eyes upon you?

hamlet@20282	
hamlet@20283	HORATIO	It would have much amazed you.
hamlet@20322	
hamlet@20323	HAMLET	Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?

hamlet@20502	HAMLET	                  His beard was grizzled--no?
hamlet@20555

hamlet@20603		A sable silver'd.
hamlet@20622	
hamlet@20623	HAMLET	                  I will watch to-night;

hamlet@20701	
hamlet@20702	HORATIO	I warrant it will.
hamlet@20729	
hamlet@20730	HAMLET	If it assume my noble father's person,
hamlet@20776		I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
hamlet@20826		And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
hamlet@20869		If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
hamlet@20913		Let it be tenable in your silence still;
hamlet@20955		And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
hamlet@20996		Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
hamlet@21038		I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
hamlet@21085		Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
hamlet@21131		I'll visit you.
hamlet@21148	
hamlet@21149	All	                  Our duty to your honour.
hamlet@21196	
hamlet@21197	HAMLET	Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.

hamlet@21269		My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;

hamlet@21502	
hamlet@21503	
hamlet@21504	
hamlet@21505	SCENE III	A room in Polonius' house.
hamlet@21542	
hamlet@21543	
hamlet@21544		[Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA]
hamlet@21573	
hamlet@21574	LAERTES	My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
hamlet@21621		And, sister, as the winds give benefit
hamlet@21661		And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
hamlet@21701		But let me hear from you.
hamlet@21728	
hamlet@21729	OPHELIA	Do you doubt that?
hamlet@21756	
hamlet@21757	LAERTES	For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
hamlet@21808		Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
hamlet@21847		A violet in the youth of primy nature,
hamlet@21887		Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
hamlet@21932		The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
hamlet@21982	
hamlet@21983	OPHELIA	       No more but so?
hamlet@22014	
hamlet@22015	LAERTES	Think it no more;
hamlet@22041		For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
hamlet@22084		In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
hamlet@22131		The inward service of the mind and soul
hamlet@22172		Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
hamlet@22218		And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
hamlet@22260		The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
hamlet@22304		His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
hamlet@22353		For he himself is subject to his birth:
hamlet@22394		He may not, as unvalued persons do,
hamlet@22431		Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
hamlet@22477		The safety and health of this whole state;
hamlet@22521		And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
hamlet@22569		Unto the voice and yielding of that body
hamlet@22611		Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
hamlet@22666		It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
hamlet@22708		As he in his particular act and place
hamlet@22747		May give his saying deed; which is no further
hamlet@22794		Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
hamlet@22839		Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
hamlet@22886		If with too credent ear you list his songs,
hamlet@22931		Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
hamlet@22981		To his unmaster'd importunity.
hamlet@23013		Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
hamlet@23057		And keep you in the rear of your affection,
hamlet@23102		Out of the shot and danger of desire.
hamlet@23141		The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
hamlet@23180		If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
hamlet@23219		Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
hamlet@23266		The canker galls the infants of the spring,
hamlet@23311		Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
hamlet@23355		And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
hamlet@23396		Contagious blastments are most imminent.
hamlet@23438		Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
hamlet@23479		Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
hamlet@23527	
hamlet@23528	OPHELIA	I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
hamlet@23581		As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
hamlet@23629		Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
hamlet@23669		Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
hamlet@23714		Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
hamlet@23761		Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
hamlet@23809		And recks not his own rede.
hamlet@23838	
hamlet@23839	LAERTES	O, fear me not.
hamlet@23863		I stay too long: but here my father comes.
hamlet@23907	
hamlet@23908		[Enter POLONIUS]
hamlet@23926	
hamlet@23927		A double blessing is a double grace,

hamlet@24003	
hamlet@24004	LORD POLONIUS	Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
hamlet@24064		The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
hamlet@24109		And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
hamlet@24164		And these few precepts in thy memory
hamlet@24202		See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
hamlet@24252		Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
hamlet@24293		Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
hamlet@24336		Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
hamlet@24388		Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
hamlet@24435		But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
hamlet@24480		Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
hamlet@24528		Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
hamlet@24569		Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
hamlet@24614		Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
hamlet@24658		Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
hamlet@24710		Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
hamlet@24750		But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
hamlet@24796		For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
hamlet@24836		And they in France of the best rank and station
hamlet@24885		Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
hamlet@24935		Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
hamlet@24972		For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
hamlet@25016		And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
hamlet@25060		This above all: to thine ownself be true,
hamlet@25103		And it must follow, as the night the day,
hamlet@25146		Thou canst not then be false to any man.
hamlet@25188		Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
hamlet@25232	
hamlet@25233	LAERTES	Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
hamlet@25282	
hamlet@25283	LORD POLONIUS	The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
hamlet@25343	
hamlet@25344	LAERTES	Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
hamlet@25389		What I have said to you.
hamlet@25415	
hamlet@25416	OPHELIA	'Tis in my memory lock'd,
hamlet@25450		And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

hamlet@25522	
hamlet@25523	LORD POLONIUS	What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
hamlet@25578	
hamlet@25579	OPHELIA	So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
hamlet@25638	
hamlet@25639	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well bethought:
hamlet@25676		'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
hamlet@25716		Given private time to you; and you yourself
hamlet@25761		Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
hamlet@25814		If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
hamlet@25850		And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
hamlet@25896		You do not understand yourself so clearly
hamlet@25939		As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
hamlet@25983		What is between you? give me up the truth.
hamlet@26027	
hamlet@26028	OPHELIA	He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
hamlet@26080		Of his affection to me.
hamlet@26105	
hamlet@26106	LORD POLONIUS	Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
hamlet@26166		Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
hamlet@26207		Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
hamlet@26254	
hamlet@26255	OPHELIA	I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
hamlet@26308	
hamlet@26309	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
hamlet@26369		That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
hamlet@26418		Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
hamlet@26472		Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
hamlet@26519		Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
hamlet@26562	
hamlet@26563	OPHELIA	My lord, he hath importuned me with love
hamlet@26612		In honourable fashion.
hamlet@26636	
hamlet@26637	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
hamlet@26694	
hamlet@26695	OPHELIA	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
hamlet@26754		With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
hamlet@26796	
hamlet@26797	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
hamlet@26855		When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
hamlet@26900		Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
hamlet@26948		Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
hamlet@26995		Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
hamlet@27038		You must not take for fire. From this time
hamlet@27082		Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
hamlet@27128		Set your entreatments at a higher rate
hamlet@27168		Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
hamlet@27212		Believe so much in him, that he is young
hamlet@27254		And with a larger tether may he walk
hamlet@27292		Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
hamlet@27333		Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
hamlet@27381		Not of that dye which their investments show,
hamlet@27428		But mere implorators of unholy suits,
hamlet@27467		Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
hamlet@27511		The better to beguile. This is for all:
hamlet@27552		I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
hamlet@27604		Have you so slander any moment leisure,
hamlet@27645		As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
hamlet@27693		Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
hamlet@27735

hamlet@28063	HORATIO	Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
hamlet@28125		Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

hamlet@28169		[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within]
